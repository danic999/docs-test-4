# Privacy

Microblink is committed to responsible and compliant management of data. 

The BlinkID SDK is an entirely client-side processed solution. Nowhere in the use of the SDK will any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) leave the client device. This will ensure that all customer data is handled responsibly by your application and that sensitive data is not being shared frivolously.

BlinkID can also be offered as a server-processed solution whereby identity document classification and extraction occurs on your server using a self-hosted deployment or on Microblink's server using a Cloud API. Options are available to ensure data is processed in an agreeable environment and not stored or used for purposes beyond the immediate use case.

Microblink subscribes to the ISO 27001 information security framework and has also adopted the ISO 27701 Privacy Information Management System extension. As part of our annual certification process, all controls relevant to the processing or storing of sensitive data are rigorously tested for security and compliance.
